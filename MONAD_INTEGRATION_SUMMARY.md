# Monad Integration Summary

## Overview

We've successfully integrated the StageFun application with the Monad blockchain, a high-performance Ethereum-compatible L1 that offers 10,000 transactions per second. This document summarizes the changes made.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hardhat Configuration

- Updated `hardhat.config.js` to add Monad network configurations:
  - Added `monadTestnet` network (chainId: 10143)
  - Added `monadMainnet` network (chainId: 1024)
  - Updated solidity version to 0.8.24

### 2. Environment Variables

- Added Monad-specific environment variables to `.env.local`:
  - `MONAD_TESTNET_RPC_URL`
  - `MONAD_MAINNET_RPC_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKCHAIN_EXPLORER`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID`

### 3. Database Schema

- Created a new migration file `20250227000000_monad_blockchain_columns.sql` to add:
  - `blockchain_network` column to store the blockchain name
  - `blockchain_explorer_url` column to store the transaction explorer URL
  - Updated table comments to document the new columns

### 4. TypeScript Types

- Updated the `Pool` type in `src/lib/supabase.ts` to include:
  - `blockchain_network?: string`
  - `blockchain_explorer_url?: string`

### 5. Backend API

- Updated `src/app/api/blockchain/create-pool/route.ts` to:
  - Determine which blockchain network to use based on environment variables
  - Use the appropriate RPC URL for Monad
  - Update the pool with pending status before waiting for confirmation
  - Determine the explorer URL based on the blockchain network
  - Store blockchain network and explorer URL in the database
  - Return network and explorer URL information in the API response

### 6. Frontend UI

- Updated `src/app/pools/[id]/page.tsx` to:
  - Display the blockchain network in the UI
  - Use the stored explorer URL or generate one based on the network
  - Add a helper function to get the correct explorer URL

### 7. Deployment Scripts

- Created `scripts/deploy-monad.js` for deploying to Monad
- Created `scripts/deploy-to-monad.sh` shell script for easy deployment
- Added npm scripts to `package.json`:
  - `deploy:monad-testnet`
  - `deploy:monad-local`

### 8. Documentation

- Created `MONAD_DEPLOYMENT.md` with detailed deployment instructions
- Updated `README.md` to include Monad integration information

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the integration on Monad testnet
2. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for transactions on Monad
3. **Performance Optimization**: Leverage Monad's high throughput for batch operations
4. **User Education**: Update user documentation to explain Monad benefits

## Benefits of Monad Integration

1. **Higher Throughput**: 10,000 TPS compared to Ethereum's ~15 TPS
2. **Lower Fees**: Reduced gas costs for users
3. **Faster Confirmations**: Quicker transaction finality
4. **Ethereum Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Ethereum tools
5. **Future-Proof**: Positioned to scale with growing user demand
